Kunal: Helped with the idea generating / brainstorm process. Downloaded fleet database. Worked with Cameron on the Project Background and Project Objective. Created county level EDA plots and wrote descriptions for them. Worked on the second prediction problem to predict adoption at the county level. Collaborated with Cameron to write interpretation and conclusions.

Payton: Helped come up with project ideas, downloaded half of the census data for features (with Cameron doing the other half). Grouped features and created proportions to create our final feature set, wrote the input data description section. Worked on prediction problem 3 with Ally (predicting commute time from our other data). Helped Kunal write descriptions of EDA process, did external validity testing with NorCal vs SoCal data.

Ally: Collaborated in ideation phase for model, researched data collection, and performed majority of Data Cleaning. Worked with all group members to have frequent meeting times over Zoom, checkpoints with action items, and organizing relevant files via GoogleDrive. Put together final notebook on Jupyter and fixed (multiple) bugs when inputting various parts of code.

Cameron: Contributed to the initial brainstorming process of choosing a topic. Downloaded half of the data used for our features (Payton did other half) from the Census Bureau. Wrote much of the Project Background and Project Objective sections, contributed in smaller part to the Interpretation and Conclusion and Abstract sections. Collaborated with Kunal in organizing and coding the first two prediction problems (I mostly worked on the first, Kunal on the second).
